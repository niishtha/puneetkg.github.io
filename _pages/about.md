I am a Senior Business Analyst, with extensive experience in applying machine learning to advance business and Product. I like to solve problems through data.
# I have recently started producing my podcast series, "Data Science in a hurry", here i talk about the logic of what machine learning is and dissect each ML technique into basics that can be learnt on the go and will be moving this upto to interviewing the well known Data Scientists in India and abroad. Will slowly be making youtube videos to explain the same.
When i am not dabbling into data science, you will find me doing one of the following; reading about Astrophysics, suspense thrillers & Sci-fi genres, playing guitar, creating music, solving rubik's cube.
