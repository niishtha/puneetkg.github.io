I am a Creative Data Scientist, with extensive experience in applying machine learning to advance business and Product. I like to solve problems through data.

I have recently started producing my podcast series, ***"Data Science in a hurry"*** (in works), here i talk about the logic of what machine learning is and dissect each ML technique into basics that can be understood on the go and interview the top data scientists that are solving niche problems and shaping the lives of many in various fields like Material Science, Economics, e-commerce etc.

When i am not dabbling into data science, you will find me doing one of the following; Reading Astrophysics, suspense thrillers & Sci-fi genres, playing guitar & creating music, Sketching & Painting, engaging in sports like basketball, football or solving rubik's cube(3x3 to 5x5).
